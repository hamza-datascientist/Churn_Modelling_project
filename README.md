Project Overview

This project is focused on building a Machine Learning model using Linear Regression to make accurate predictions.
It includes full data cleaning, model training, evaluation, and a simple dashboard to visualize insights and results.

Key Features
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues
Converted raw data into a usable, clean dataset

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Checked correlations, distributions, and patterns
Identified key variables that impact the prediction

3. Machine Learning Model (Linear Regression)
Trained a Linear Model
Evaluated performance
Tuned parameters for better accuracy
Generated final predictions

4. Interactive Dashboard

Created a dashboard to show
Key metrics
Prediction results
Insights and charts

5. Production-Ready Workflow
Proper folder structure
Step-by-step Git commits
Clean and readable code
